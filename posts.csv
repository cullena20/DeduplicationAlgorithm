We’ve got another update from our Sandbox team to dive into, this time exploring more about abilities and changes on the way to subclass fun with the next expansion.



Destiny 2’s newest damage type, Strand, is arriving in Lightfall, and we’re beyond excited for you to play around with it—but that’s not why we’re here today. No, we don’t have any additional Strand gameplay details to share just yet. Instead, we’ll be talking about some general ability updates and quality-of-life changes we’re making in Lightfall and beyond.


#The Road Traveled, and the Path Ahead


With the release of Arc 3.0 alongside Season of Plunder, we completed moving all three Light subclasses to the Subclass 3.0 system. These updated subclasses allow players more customization and buildcrafting capabilities than ever before.



Now that all the 3.0 subclasses are out in the wild, we have some tuning work to do on the various systems connected to the subclasses. One such system is our core character stats. The amount of ability regeneration that the discipline, strength, and class ability specific stats provide hasn’t been meaningfully touched since the launch of Shadowkeep. Since then, across Aspects, Fragments, Exotic armor, armor mods, and weapon perks, there are a variety of ways to have powerful abilities with very high uptime. This has resulted in some PvE activities losing the tension that made them special and introduced additional noise into the Crucible.



Moving forward, our goal with ability uptime in both PvE and PvP is to get back to roughly where we were when the 30th Anniversary Pack launched in December 2021. We’re making some changes to the ability energy economy in Lightfall and subsequent Seasons to correct ability uptime, while still rewarding players for investing in buildcrafting and fine-tuning their Guardian into the perfect monster-slaying machine.



For Lightfall, we are making the following change, focused on passive cooldown gains:



* Rescaled the efficacy of discipline, strength, and each class ability stat on grenade, melee, and class ability regeneration rates:

   * In general, the regeneration provided by a tier 10 stat is now roughly equivalent to a tier 8 in the previous system.
   * Each stat tier now provides a more consistent gain in cooldown reduction rather than spiking heavily at lower tiers.

Destiny 2 is a game about space magic, and your abilities will always be central to your combat loop. While this change looks like a lot on paper, we believe the buildcrafting improvements coming in Lightfall will more than make up for it. As a quick example, your Legendary armor now has three type-specific mod slots (up from two) that can fit a wide variety of mods that are no longer restricted by elemental affinity.



Starting in Lightfall, you’ll be able to run all the following ability energy generating mods at the same time, and more freely be able to socket multiple copies of each:



* Bomber
* Outreach
* Impact Induction
* Utility Kickstart
* Melee Kickstart
* Grenade Kickstart
* Invigoration
* Insulation
* Innervation
* Hands On
* Ashes to Assets
* Dynamo

Additionally, armor mod energy costs have been reduced across the board, and artifact mods no longer need to be slotted into your armor, giving you more space to buildcraft to your heart’s content. In fact, so much is changing and being added in Lightfall that we expect players will find unique combinations of mods and perks that we didn’t anticipate. In the coming Seasons, we’ll continue to tune the greater ability energy economy along with updates to specific ability potency to make them feel more powerful.



In Lightfall, we’ll also be adjusting the base cooldowns of some grenade, melee, and class abilities. We’ll provide more detailed information in the patch notes when Lightfall goes live. As a preview, with Lightfall we’re reverting the base cooldown change to the Dodge class ability that was implemented in Hotfix 6.3.0.5, as we feel that their cooldown under the new stat scaling system is in a good place.



* Marksman's Dodge base cooldown reduced from 34s to 29s
* Gambler's Dodge base cooldown reduced from 46s to 38s.
#When in Roam


With the 30th Anniversary release in December 2021, we split Super regeneration times into separate tiers based on the damage potential of each Super, with roaming Supers generally having longer cooldowns than one-off Supers. While we still believe that a gradient of cooldown times based on each Super’s potency is healthier for the game, we also recognize that roaming Supers have taken a back seat in PvE content, particularly at higher difficulties where neutral-game options have grown more capable of clearing groups of enemies with Subclass 3.0 keywords.



We’re working to address this problem, and we don’t have a full suite of changes ready just yet. As a first step, in Lightfall we’re increasing the maximum number of Orbs of Power that roaming Supers can generate from 5 to 7, and reducing the number of Orbs that burst supers create from 7 to 5. We believe this split more cleanly reinforces the gameplay role of these types of Supers, and still provides space for burst Supers to shine in combat. With future releases, we plan to do a larger tuning pass to balance roaming Super performance in higher-tier content.



* Roaming Supers

   * Increased the maximum number of Orbs of Power that can be created via defeating targets from 5 to 7.
* One-off Supers

   * Decreased the maximum number of Orbs of Power that can be created via defeating targets from 7 to 5.

      * Note: The Orb of Power generation from Well of Radiance, Ward of Dawn, and both Shadowshot variants is unchanged.

We are also making a change to the only three Supers in our longest cooldown tier, reducing their base cooldown by one tier.



* Hammer of Sol, Daybreak, and Spectral Blades

   * Base cooldown reduced from 10:25 to 9:16.

We’d also like to take this opportunity to detail a few ability-specific tuning changes coming with Lightfall. This is not a comprehensive list (which, as always, will be found in our patch notes), but it represents a portion of the major changes we’re making.



First up, Ward of Dawn. With Void 3.0, Ward of Dawn was reintroduced as a selectable Super rather than being tied to Sentinel Shield. As we’ve introduced more objective game modes into the Crucible with Zone Control, Iron Banner: Fortress, and Zone Capture Trials, it’s become clear that Ward of Dawn is overperforming. We don’t want to reduce its functionality in PvE content, and in general, we still want Ward of Dawn to be a strong option when you need to lock down a point on a map, but we’re making a few changes to make dislodging players from a Ward of Dawn more realistic in normal play.



* Ward of Dawn

   * Ward of Dawn maximum health reduced from 13500 to 8000

      * Damage dealt to the Ward by PvE combatants has been reduced to compensate. In general, Ward of Dawn’s effective health in PvE should not meaningfully change.
* Standardized the damage dealt by each type of Kinetic and Energy weapon against the Ward itself. Previously, Energy weapons did 2.5x damage to Ward of Dawn, and Kinetic weapons did 1x damage. Now regardless of damage type, all weapons do 1.5x damage to the Ward.
* Armor of Light has been updated to reduce its potency in PvP:

   * Maximum health reduced from 425 to 300.
   * Now inherits Void Overshield's 50% PvE damage resistance.
   * No longer negates precision damage.

Similarly, Thundercrash is currently proving to be too difficult to counter or escape in high-level Crucible modes and is too strong at both its psuedo-roaming and shutdown roles. Our goal with these changes is to bring it in line without compromising on its fantasy of allowing you to be the missile. This also felt like a good opportunity to give Fists of Havoc a damage boost against PvE targets, so we’re including that as well.



* Thundercrash

   * Reduced maximum flight time from 5s to 4.5s.
   * Reduced size of the damaging volume around the player while in flight by 20%, and pushed it further forward in front of the player to make fly-by disintegrations more intentional.
   * Descent now begins earlier in flight.
   * Reduced landing detonation size vs. players by ~20%.
   * Unchanged vs. PvE targets.
* Fists of Havoc

   * Increased PvE damage by 20%.

Arc 3.0’s Spark of Resistance Fragment is achieving our intended goal of making close-range combat safer to engage with, but it’s a bit too easy to keep rolling throughout an entire PvE encounter or Crucible skirmish. We’re making a couple of changes here to increase the difficulty of doing so without changing its potency while you’re in the fray.



* Spark of Resistance

   * Increased nearby enemy count requirement for activation from 2 to 3.
   * Reduced linger time after you're no longer surrounded from 4s to 2s.

With Solar 3.0, the increased Daybreak duration provided by Dawnblade’s Attunement of Flame path was removed, which has left Daybreak in a lackluster place. With Lightfall, in addition to the cooldown reduction detailed above, we’re reducing its attack cost and increasing its damage output against PvE targets.



* Daybreak

   * Super energy cost reduced from 10% to 6.5% per swing.
   * Increased PvE damage by 25%.

Phoenix Dive has also struggled to find a solid role in most gameplay styles and is too difficult to justify picking over Healing or Empowering Rift, so we’re making a suite of changes to increase its viability across game modes, including a base cooldown reduction.



* Phoenix Dive

   * Base cooldown reduced from 82s to 55s.
   * While Heat Rises is active, Phoenix Dive’s Restoration duration increased from 1s to 3s.
   * While Daybreak is active, Phoenix Dive's cooldown is significantly reduced, allowing for rapid reactivations.
   * While Daybreak is active, Phoenix Dive’s detonation maximum damage increased from 80 to 220.
#Crash Test Guardians


Pretty soon, Guardians are getting a little sturdier. Starting in Lightfall, physics collision damage will no longer be lethal to Guardians. Fall damage will still be lethal when Lightfall launches, but we plan to also make that nonlethal in a mid-Season update. You’ll still take damage from physics collisions, but it will generally leave you at 1HP instead of outright splattering you.



We hope you’ll take this newfound freedom and run with it. We’ve found it’s more fun to hurl ourselves headlong into danger without worrying about what’s in our way. We’re Guardians, after all.


#New Tools in the Arsenal


As part of our buildcrafting enhancements in Lightfall, we’ll be adding some new Fragments to the Light subclasses and updating a handful of Fragments on Solar and Void to tie into the new subclass pickups: Void Breaches and Firesprites. Some of these Fragment additions are intended as spiritual successors to combat style mods that aren’t making the jump over to the new armor buildcrafting system, and some are brand new additions intended to open access to subclass verbs that some classes didn’t have before.



Here are the details:



**Arc**



* Spark of Instinct (New!)

   * When critically wounded, taking damage from nearby enemies emits a burst of damaging Arc energy that Jolts targets.
* Spark of Haste (New!)

   * You have greatly increased resilience, recovery, and mobility while sprinting.

**Solar**



* Firesprite (New!)

   * Firesprites are created by a suite of new and existing Solar Fragments, and grant grenade energy on pickup.
* Ember of Mercy (New!)

   * When you revive an ally, you and other nearby allies gain Restoration. Picking up a Firesprite grants Restoration.
* Ember of Resolve (New!)

   * Solar grenade final blows Cure you.
* Ember of Tempering

   * Now creates a Firesprite on Solar weapon kills while active, in addition to its original effects.
* Ember of Combustion

   * Now creates a Firesprite on Solar Super defeats, in addition to its original effects.
* Ember of Searing

   * Now creates a Firesprite when defeating Scorched targets, in addition to its original effects.

**Void**



* Void Breach (New!)

   * Void Breaches are created by a selection of new and existing Void Fragments, and grant class ability energy on pickup.
* Echo of Cessation (New!)

   * Finisher final blows create a burst of Void damage that causes nearby enemies to become Volatile. Defeating Volatile targets creates a Void Breach.
* Echo of Vigilance (New!)

   * Defeating a target when your shields are depleted grants you a temporary Void Overshield.
* Echo of Domineering

   * Now creates a Void Breach when defeating Suppressed targets, in addition to its original effects.
* Echo of Harvest

   * Now creates a Void Breach when defeating Weakened targets with precision damage, in addition to its original effects.
* Echo of Starvation

   * Now grants Devour on picking up a Void Breach, in addition to its original effects.

In case you missed the [buildcrafting update](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/buildcrafting) from a couple weeks back, we’ve also added ways for your subclass keywords to counter Champions. While we still expect weapons and Seasonal artifact mods to be the primary ways you counter Champions in high-level PvE content, we’ve found that the subclass keywords are a solid complement to round out your loadouts or get your fireteam out of a tight spot when an Unstoppable Champion is barreling toward you. We'll be keeping an eye on this when it goes live, and we’re excited to see players use it!



That’s it from the Gameplay team today. We hope you’re looking forward to Lightfall, and we’ll see you on the other side.",DTG_Bot,https://reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/10x63s8/to_abilities_and_beyond_a_look_at_the_past/,"Name: To Abilities and Beyond - A Look at the Past, Present, and Future of 3.0, Content: Source: https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/ability-changes-lightfall-d2

* Standardized the damage dealt by each type of Kinetic and Energy weapon against the Ward itself. Previously, Energy weapons did 2.5x damage to Ward of Dawn, and Kinetic weapons did 1x damage. Now regardless of damage type, all weapons do 1.5x damage to the Ward.
* Armor of Light has been updated to reduce its potency in PvP:

   * Maximum health reduced from 425 to 300.
   * Now inherits Void Overshield's 50% PvE damage resistance.
   * No longer negates precision damage.

Similarly, Thundercrash is currently proving to be too difficult to counter or escape in high-level Crucible modes and is too strong at both its psuedo-roaming and shutdown roles. Our goal with these changes is to bring it in line without compromising on its fantasy of allowing you to be the missile. This also felt like a good opportunity to give Fists of Havoc a damage boost against PvE targets, so we’re including that as well.



* Thundercrash

   * Reduced maximum flight time from 5s to 4.5s.
   * Reduced size of the damaging volume around the player while in flight by 20%, and pushed it further forward in front of the player to make fly-by disintegrations more intentional.
   * Descent now begins earlier in flight.
   * Reduced landing detonation size vs. players by ~20%.
   * Unchanged vs. PvE targets.
* Fists of Havoc

   * Increased PvE damage by 20%.

Arc 3.0’s Spark of Resistance Fragment is achieving our intended goal of making close-range combat safer to engage with, but it’s a bit too easy to keep rolling throughout an entire PvE encounter or Crucible skirmish. We’re making a couple of changes here to increase the difficulty of doing so without changing its potency while you’re in the fray.



* Spark of Resistance

   * Increased nearby enemy count requirement for activation from 2 to 3.
   * Reduced linger time after you're no longer surrounded from 4s to 2s.

With Solar 3.0, the increased Daybreak duration provided by Dawnblade’s Attunement of Flame path was removed, which has left Daybreak in a lackluster place. With Lightfall, in addition to the cooldown reduction detailed above, we’re reducing its attack cost and increasing its damage output against PvE targets.



* Daybreak

   * Super energy cost reduced from 10% to 6.5% per swing.
   * Increased PvE damage by 25%.

Phoenix Dive has also struggled to find a solid role in most gameplay styles and is too difficult to justify picking over Healing or Empowering Rift, so we’re making a suite of changes to increase its viability across game modes, including a base cooldown reduction.



* Phoenix Dive

   * Base cooldown reduced from 82s to 55s.
   * While Heat Rises is active, Phoenix Dive’s Restoration duration increased from 1s to 3s.
   * While Daybreak is active, Phoenix Dive's cooldown is significantly reduced, allowing for rapid reactivations.
   * While Daybreak is active, Phoenix Dive’s detonation maximum damage increased from 80 to 220.
#Crash Test Guardians


Pretty soon, Guardians are getting a little sturdier. Starting in Lightfall, physics collision damage will no longer be lethal to Guardians. Fall damage will still be lethal when Lightfall launches, but we plan to also make that nonlethal in a mid-Season update. You’ll still take damage from physics collisions, but it will generally leave you at 1HP instead of outright splattering you.



We hope you’ll take this newfound freedom and run with it. We’ve found it’s more fun to hurl ourselves headlong into danger without worrying about what’s in our way. We’re Guardians, after all.


#New Tools in the Arsenal


As part of our buildcrafting enhancements in Lightfall, we’ll be adding some new Fragments to the Light subclasses and updating a handful of Fragments on Solar and Void to tie into the new subclass pickups: Void Breaches and Firesprites. Some of these Fragment additions are intended as spiritual successors to combat style mods that aren’t making the jump over to the new armor buildcrafting system, and some are brand new additions intended to open access to subclass verbs that some classes didn’t have before.



Here are the details:



**Arc**



* Spark of Instinct (New!)

   * When critically wounded, taking damage from nearby enemies emits a burst of damaging Arc energy that Jolts targets.
* Spark of Haste (New!)

   * You have greatly increased resilience, recovery, and mobility while sprinting.

**Solar**



* Firesprite (New!)

   * Firesprites are created by a suite of new and existing Solar Fragments, and grant grenade energy on pickup.
* Ember of Mercy (New!)

   * When you revive an ally, you and other nearby allies gain Restoration. Picking up a Firesprite grants Restoration.
* Ember of Resolve (New!)

   * Solar grenade final blows Cure you.
* Ember of Tempering

   * Now creates a Firesprite on Solar weapon kills while active, in addition to its original effects.
* Ember of Combustion

   * Now creates a Firesprite on Solar Super defeats, in addition to its original effects.
* Ember of Searing

   * Now creates a Firesprite when defeating Scorched targets, in addition to its original effects.

**Void**



* Void Breach (New!)

   * Void Breaches are created by a selection of new and existing Void Fragments, and grant class ability energy on pickup.
* Echo of Cessation (New!)

   * Finisher final blows create a burst of Void damage that causes nearby enemies to become Volatile. Defeating Volatile targets creates a Void Breach.
* Echo of Vigilance (New!)

   * Defeating a target when your shields are depleted grants you a temporary Void Overshield.
* Echo of Domineering

   * Now creates a Void Breach when defeating Suppressed targets, in addition to its original effects.
* Echo of Harvest

   * Now creates a Void Breach when defeating Weakened targets with precision damage, in addition to its original effects.
* Echo of Starvation

   * Now grants Devour on picking up a Void Breach, in addition to its original effects.

In case you missed the [buildcrafting update](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/buildcrafting) from a couple weeks back, we’ve also added ways for your subclass keywords to counter Champions. While we still expect weapons and Seasonal artifact mods to be the primary ways you counter Champions in high-level PvE content, we’ve found that the subclass keywords are a solid complement to round out your loadouts or get your fireteam out of a tight spot when an Unstoppable Champion is barreling toward you. We'll be keeping an eye on this when it goes live, and we’re excited to see players use it!



That’s it from the Gameplay team today. We hope you’re looking forward to Lightfall, and we’ll see you on the other side., Author: DTG_Bot, Uri: https://reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/10x63s8/to_abilities_and_beyond_a_look_at_the_past/"

7,School is nothing like how real life works and teachers should stop saying that it does,"1. In almost any setting other than school it is okay to not know everything and use your phone/computer to help you look up something. Gasp.

3. Most of us do not need to know 90% of what we are forced to learn (yeah I said forced). College also forces us to learn stuff that has nothing to do with our majors and this wastes our time and money (just extra wasted time as if elementary and high school weren’t enough).

8,I intentionally block a driveway into a wealthy religious private school on my way into work,"During my morning commute, I pass a very wealthy private religious school. The driveway getting in and out of the school is tricky and most people are turning left and crossing traffic to leave. When going straight on the main road, there’s a light ahead and when it’s red during morning rush hour, traffic backs up a lot.

Most people who are going straight will leave enough space for the people exiting the school to get out. Thing is a lot of people leaving the school and turning left will block the straight lane, holding up traffic until the other lane is clear and they can turn. 

It makes me mad when the people exiting the school block traffic like this. Also I have an issue with the school (and parents who pay to send their kids there) because it’s a super wealthy private religious institution that is very anti-LGBTQ, very “pro-life” and they walk a very fine line with political support. It also received a hefty PPP loan when it’s clearly a wealthy private institution (it costs parents a stupid amount to send their kids there) that didn’t need one. 

So I’m petty and I’ve taken to blocking the driveway of the school so people can’t get out when the light ahead is red and traffic backs up. It makes me happy to see the frustrated parents muttering, shouting and glaring at me from their fancy cars cause they can’t get through, despite trying to inch forward.

9,Remember that AITA thread where the guy let his long-term girlfriend get deported? I was in a similar situation until recently...,"A while back there was this AITA thread where the OP explains that his girlfriend of five years was trying to stay in his country to be with him (didn’t have a stable visa). She had a job but was laid off, losing her visa. She desperately tried to get another job with sponsorship and he told her they could marry to make things easier. When time was up and she couldn’t find work, he changed his mind and told her he didn’t want to be responsible for her. She was deported, and she subsequently killed herself.

Well, I stumbled across it a couple months ago and I realized that I was kind of in a similar situation to that girl. It kind of rattled me! For context, I am a postgraduate student in my now-ex partner’s country. Partner of four years asked me a year ago to stay in the country so we can stay together. I was skeptical because I was so worried about getting a decent job in this country, but was assured he would support me while I figured it out. He thought I was ""the one"". I enrolled in the PhD program and we moved in together. I realized I was in this country primarily for him but he was still not committing. I started thinking, this is pretty scary - is it good for me?

Recently, he started making demands I could not meet, like how we must pay everything 50/50, even though I made a 25k salary a year to his 80k. He doesn’t cook, rarely cleans: already unequal. He claimed that he planned his life whereas I “didn’t plan my life well” so being equal makes sense to him. He also reminded me that he “never promised me anything”. When he asked me to stay, I voiced my worry about job opportunities for me: recently he said I needed to make it work because I ""promised him"" when I agreed to stay... the delusion!

I said I couldn’t see a happy future like this, and to please understand my situation. I've been job searching on top of PhD research - and working a part time job! Maybe we could work something out since it has been difficult for me? At this, he instead asked to breakup saying our ""personalities don't match"". I have a year left on my visa and don’t see good, fulfilling prospects for me in this country, so I am preparing to start over again at home.

I feel betrayed but I also feel stupid and naive: like a failure. I understand the pain and fear of that poor girl… but I am glad it is over while I still have footing. To be honest, I would find more success back home. I will take time to love myself more than another person. I am trying my best to move on and be positive. If you read my story, thank you.

**Memory transcription subject:** ***Chief Hunter Isif, Arxur Dominion Sector Fleet***

*Date \[standardized human time\]: December 3, 2136*

The Sol System underwent a serious overhaul, since my last visit. Earth’s defenses had been insufficient to ward off enemy vessels, and humanity wished to ensure such defeat never happened again. I marveled at the sheer manpower they must’ve dedicated to reconstruction.

According to my sensor data, the humans placed habitats as far out as the ‘Oort Cloud.’ It was impossible to spot the roughshod stations on the viewport. Their super-black paint absorbed almost all light, and their emissions were the only giveaway. A lesser mind might mistake the gravitational disturbances for an astronomical phenomenon.

*I would assume the UN mimicked our cloaked stations, but they couldn’t have developed the technology so quickly. Terrans devised those blueprints on their own.*

Humans detected my ship among the icy fragments, and nailed me with enough FTL-disruptors to fry an army. Nimble fighters raced out to join me, taking up flank positions. Visual contact confirmed to Terran scouts that the incoming vessel was of Arxur make, but that didn’t ease their suspicions. Perhaps they assumed the next Dominion visit wouldn’t be on friendly terms.

The Terran craft had me target-locked, and circled my ship with contemplative intent. Surely their generals realized that despite our solitary nature, our ships wouldn’t venture off alone to attack. My mission was diplomatic in nature; I was debating how thoroughly to betray my people. There was also the issue of the three Zurulians, who wouldn’t come out when I left drinking water. They must be dehydrated and delirious by now.

I hailed the cloaked habitat, hoping humanity wouldn’t make any rash decisions. It was unclear if they’d appreciate the tip-off, that their hideout wasn’t undetectable. An honest appraisal seemed helpful by my standards, but it could also wound Terran pride. That concept meant more to the Dominion than Elias Meier; however, Míngzé Zhao was not as even-keel.

“You are trespassing in the Sol system, but you know that already.” A female human with a dust-colored bowl cut appeared on screen. I recognized her as General Jones, the drone program’s lead. “To what do we owe the…*pleasure*?”

I bared my teeth. “Humans do not wish to continue open relations? Have you forgotten what we did for you so soon?”

“We didn’t expect the Arxur back here, keeping tabs on us. I know a warship when I see one, and I certainly don’t like it gunning for Earth. Why do you feel entitled to roam our home system?”

“Because I’m Chief Hunter Isif. You know, the single reason your species is still alive today. The one who gave you an army, sent food to your cities, pulled your dying from the rubble, and traded you the Venlil.”

“…I see. My nation thanked you, and housed you. That doesn’t mean you’re going to lord your aid over humanity forever. You must use proper diplomatic channels, like everyone else.”

“I’ve gone through your channels, and received a dismissive statement from Zhao. That’s unacceptable. I’ve earned some gratitude, if not respect.”

“What are you going to do, sue us?”

Malice glimmered in General Jones’ eyes, and a defiant smirk tugged at her lips. Fury swelled in my chest, threatening to spill into a roar. I was able to contain it to a growl, but I couldn’t believe what ingrates the humans were. The United Nations hadn’t been this flippant with me in the past, even after Meier’s death.

*Why the sudden hostility? I came to help humanity, but now, I don’t know whether they deserve it.*

Perhaps there was some truth to Shaza’s claim that the Terrans needed a kick in the teeth. If she took their bold-faced antagonism down a notch, that would be beneficial to my goals. Earth’s government warranted a reminder of their precarious position. I was less certain that I could rely on their leaders than ever.

Still, humans were the only predators who wanted to end sapient farming. Their lab-grown meat had the power to feed us, and to weaken Betterment’s grip on Arxur society. Terrans must see reason again, when I reminded them we were on the same side. Meier understood how I defended humanity, and kept Giznel off their back.

Concerns still hounded me over the three Zurulians, hiding on my ship. I’d risked my cover on impulse, and I couldn’t have them die after ferrying them here. It was worth brushing off the insult, so that my defective voice would settle down. However, I’d like to hear General Jones issue an apology, down the line. Her contemptful look was grating at my patience.

“I’m your only ally in the Dominion. The intelligence I can offer you is worth your time,” I hissed.

The primate cleared her throat. “You have something you want to share? Then spit it out.”

“I’ll only speak to Zhao. I rule this entire sector: your sector. I directly interact with our government, and keep them off your backs. I deserve to look my equal in the eye, yes?”

“Well, tough luck. The Secretary-General is unavailable.”

“Then so am I. You haven’t even forwarded the request to him. If your leader can’t spare a minute on a call, I can’t be bothered to share my thoughts.”

“I said he’s unavailable. I will apprise Zhao of any intel you divulge to us.”

“I want a personal chat, human! Are you fucking dense?”

Jones slanted her eyebrows. “How dare—”

“How dare YOU!” I roared. “If it was important…if I was Tarva, Zhao would make time. Hell, Tarva *herself* was more diplomatic than you people!”

The UN fighters still coasted alongside me, and I barely refrained from target-locking them. I was mistaken to think of humanity as a friend; they would always consider us second-class to the prey. The option to storm off, and communicate with Venlil Prime instead, grew more appealing by the minute. If the Terrans hadn’t disrupted my FTL capabilities, I would’ve left in a huff.

There was no logical reason the humans would confront an Arxur ally, and spit in his face. Perhaps their vengeance had driven them mad; it was clear they were obsessed with Sol’s military defenses. Another possibility was that this American general was superseding the chain of command. She could be seeking to claim my intel for her nation alone.

Was that it? Was Jones shutting Zhao out of the loop, as a power play? Coups weren’t unheard of, back when unrest plagued Wriss; rulers could change by the week.

The drone mastermind might resent that she was snubbed for Secretary-General, in favor of a general from a rival state. Undermining Zhao’s regime would fashion the Americans as an appealing alternative. The ostensible status was that humans quieted all clannish tendencies, under threat of extinction. The United Nations supposedly helped them work together against aliens. But I wasn’t sure Earth’s tribes had laid old grudges to rest.

General Jones tapped a few buttons, before sitting in silence for a minute. “Be careful what you wish for, Isif. The Secretary-General will speak with you.”

I was a bit relieved that the American-led forces hadn’t done anything rash. Humans were bold enough to try to capture me, and convince me to talk through other means. From what I read on my holopad, their interrogation methods could surpass even Arxur creativity. If I’d shared those tidbits with Giznel, he’d respect their cruelty.

A human male appeared on screen, dressed in formal attire. His skin was warm and tan, while his hair was styled as a black crew cut. Forehead wrinkles indicated he was middle-aged, likely with several decades in the service. Anger oozed from his taut grimace; even his shoulders were forward, asserting dominance.

“Mr. Secretary-General, it’s an honor.” I forced a placid expression, and dipped my head. “I intended for us to meet much sooner. A shame, yes?”

Zhao’s expression didn’t change. “Well, you have my full attention now. I suppose that is what you wanted.”

“It is? That American general was stalling me from contacting you. I fear she may be watching out for her national interests, at your world’s expense.”

“General Jones and I have an understanding. National interests mean nothing, with human interests under constant threat. That threat is *extinction*, and it pays no mind to borders. We cannot afford squabbles.”

“But Jones would not pass along my call.”

“Because I told her not to. I was already listening the entire time, you know.”

My eyes narrowed with outrage, and I lashed my tail. This Secretary-General would blow me off, when I came to Sol to protect his forces? For pack predators with ubiquitous empathy, they had a lousy way of showing it. Who was I kidding, to think humans would help defective Arxur? Dominion rebellion meant nothing to their self-oriented agenda.

I knew Terrans still cared about the Venlil, like their own pack. The new Secretary-General also lauded the other races that aided Earth, yet sported contempt for the Arxur. Furthermore, they launched new ‘exchange programs’ with the Yotul and Zurulians, while welcoming defecting herbivores to their alliance. The ever-patient humans found the resolve to train the quaking prey! To my amazement, those efforts were getting results.

*Obligate carnivores just aren’t convenient to their new empire…is that it? Or maybe they cannot forgive our crimes…*

I gritted my teeth. “What have I ever done to you? I helped you and asked nothing in return. I could’ve conquered Earth, but I treated you as equals.”

“That’s the only reason I haven’t ordered Jones to capture you, Isif,” Zhao said. “With what we know today, you’re no friend of humanity. Listen carefully and tell your boss; we are not supporting agendas that go against our interests.”

“What are you talking about? Our interests are the same!”

“We both know that’s not true. You were adamant about Fahl and Sillis being glassed, and humanity following your every command. We are not your puppets.”

“What? You’ve gone mad, Zhao. The Dominion knows you are weak, and they won’t tolerate your interference. I’m trying to keep weak predators alive into the future!”

“Weak? We are not weak. We are young, and growing exponentially.”

I hissed in exasperation. “Then give yourselves time to grow. Fahl and Sillis do not help your…human first agenda, am I right?”

“It’s about the principle of encouraging our enemies to surrender. Besides, if we forked over the Tilfish and the Harchen worlds without a fight, it would cement this ‘human weakness’ in your minds. I will not set that precedent. The Arxur shall respect us.”

Secretary-General Zhao cast an unwavering glare at the screen. As much as I wanted to unload on him, my departure from Sol required humanity lifting their FTL disruptors. Securing a ride out might require groveling; politeness was mandatory for my request to leave. But at this point, I had no intent of passing along Shaza’s plans to Earth.

It felt like a betrayal, that the UN would dismiss my high-risk friendship with humanity. How could Terrans say our interests weren’t aligned, unless they were unwilling to help us? I thought we both sought a better future, and a change in the Arxur government. My defective voice wanted the hominids to like me, and accept me as one of their peers.

A delirious scream echoed behind me, and my head whipped around. One of the Zurulians had climbed atop a table, in the camera’s backdrop. It was the one who’d been crying in the cage, though she looked worse for wear. Her lips were dry from dehydration, and her eyes were half-closed with fatigue. I could see desperation glitter in her pupils.

“H-human! Help us…p-please,” she croaked, in a ragged voice.

The Secretary-General leaned forward in his chair, and his eyes widened with alarm. His jaw clenched shortly after, as he recognized the Zurulian’s paltry condition. While I appreciated that Zhao loathed our cattle practices, the quadrupeds’ deterioration wasn’t my fault. I’d risked my hide to rescue them, and I *had* provided for them. Was I supposed to flush them out at gunpoint, to drink water?

“So that’s why there are four life signatures on your ship.” The Terran’s voice was low and charged with fury. I noticed his hands typing at a holopad, likely communicating with Jones’ forces. “You’re using our friends as bargaining chips? You’d commit acts of terrorism in the Sol System?!”

I shook my head. “It’s not like that! I brought them here so you could send them home.”

“Yeah, right; conveniently forgot to mention their presence, huh? Is that your food for this week? Filthy croc.”

“That’s it! I will fucking rip you from limb-to-limb, you puny branch-swinger! I will carve out your itsy-bitsy canines…and embed them on my armor as a prize!”

“You won’t be doing anything. I was planning to catch-and-release you, but you’re better taken out of the equation. The United Nations will be bringing you into custody, Isif.”

I tried to attempt evasive maneuvers, but the UN blew out my propulsions with a single hit. My weapons system was malfunctioning, and I found the glitch rather coincidental. The Terran fighters flanking me used mechanisms to latch on to my hull seamlessly. Sparks flew behind me, as humans began breaching into the cabin. The Zurulians bounded up to the noise, yipping for aid.

The world took on a red hue, and anger overflowed into my consciousness. Feeling the need to attack something, I swung my claws at my dashboard. Electricity arced through the air, as I tore a chunk of metal out of the pedestal. Adrenaline led me to blindly throw the debris, and it nearly landed atop the Zurulians. Realizing I’d almost harmed them snapped me back to lucidity, though I was still steaming.

*Why is Zhao doing this? I was a valuable asset to him, from a logistical standpoint.*

The Secretary-General leaned in to another holopad. “This is a high-value prisoner. Bring him in, alive! I want to know what he knows.”

“You’re making a mistake!” I roared. “Why are you doing this?!”

“For one, you’ve learned too much about Earth’s revamps. The element of surprise is important, if worse comes to worst. An enemy Chief Hunter can’t ruin that for us.”

“Enemy? Meier knew I’m not your enemy. We want the same fucking thing, Zhao.”

“Meier was naïve. He couldn’t see an enemy if they were holding him at gunpoint.”

I curled my lip with disdain. “You don’t believe I’m an ally, just because I’m an Arxur.”

“No, I don’t believe you’re an ally, because we’ve…obtained Arxur reports. Including Shaza’s partial transcript of your visit.”

I leaned back on my haunches. Understanding dawned on me, as I realized that the United Nations had tapped into our communications network. Meier understood how I played things up for effect, but that knowledge hadn’t been passed on to his successor. Perhaps my acting was a bit too superb, if it fooled the very people I was protecting.

My offense over Terran aggression was gone, once there was some basis for their behavior. This was all a misunderstanding; it should be easy for me to clear things up. Of course Earth wouldn’t welcome someone who claimed to be using them in a war. It didn’t help that I insulted Zhao in my speech, though such rhetoric was tailored for a different audience.

“What is it you think that I said?” I hissed.

“‘I’m using humans to make the Dominion the supreme, unchallenged power.’ Oh, what about this one? ‘The UN are clueless to our aims, because Zhao is blind and on the warpath.’”

“You can’t take that at face value. Read between the lines! You’re intelligent. I was trying to talk Shaza down…she wants to nuke your prizes, with your forces still there.”

“We know that. And we know your rationale against an attack was ‘Not yet, save our strength.’”

A metallic section of the wall toppled inward, and Terran soldiers stalked inside. The primates almost tripped over the Zurulians, who ran toward their entry point. The humans rounded on me in formation, wearing goggles over their eyes. After a moment’s hesitation, I sunk to my knees and raised my paws in surrender.

“Why would you tell me you know all this? You’re tipping your hand,” I growled.

The Secretary-General sported a malevolent grin. “Because you’re never going to tell your people any of it.”

A dart embedded itself in my neck, and I plucked it out on instinct. My head felt a bit woozy, before I lost my balance. The humans crept closer, readying more sedatives in case the dosage was inadequate. My eyes fluttered, and my vision shrank to a pinhole. There was no hope of talking my way out of this situation…and it wasn’t the Dominion who did me in like I imagined.

My undoing was assisting alien predators, who never planned for me to leave the Sol system again.

**Memory transcription subject:** ***Chief Hunter Isif, Arxur Dominion Sector Fleet***

*Date \[standardized human time\]: December 3, 2136*

The Sol System underwent a serious overhaul, since my last visit. Earth’s defenses had been insufficient to ward off enemy vessels, and humanity wished to ensure such defeat never happened again. I marveled at the sheer manpower they must’ve dedicated to reconstruction.

According to my sensor data, the humans placed habitats as far out as the ‘Oort Cloud.’ It was impossible to spot the roughshod stations on the viewport. Their super-black paint absorbed almost all light, and their emissions were the only giveaway. A lesser mind might mistake the gravitational disturbances for an astronomical phenomenon.

*I would assume the UN mimicked our cloaked stations, but they couldn’t have developed the technology so quickly. Terrans devised those blueprints on their own.*

Humans detected my ship among the icy fragments, and nailed me with enough FTL-disruptors to fry an army. Nimble fighters raced out to join me, taking up flank positions. Visual contact confirmed to Terran scouts that the incoming vessel was of Arxur make, but that didn’t ease their suspicions. Perhaps they assumed the next Dominion visit wouldn’t be on friendly terms.

The Terran craft had me target-locked, and circled my ship with contemplative intent. Surely their generals realized that despite our solitary nature, our ships wouldn’t venture off alone to attack. My mission was diplomatic in nature; I was debating how thoroughly to betray my people. There was also the issue of the three Zurulians, who wouldn’t come out when I left drinking water. They must be dehydrated and delirious by now.

I hailed the cloaked habitat, hoping humanity wouldn’t make any rash decisions. It was unclear if they’d appreciate the tip-off, that their hideout wasn’t undetectable. An honest appraisal seemed helpful by my standards, but it could also wound Terran pride. That concept meant more to the Dominion than Elias Meier; however, Míngzé Zhao was not as even-keel.

“You are trespassing in the Sol system, but you know that already.” A female human with a dust-colored bowl cut appeared on screen. I recognized her as General Jones, the drone program’s lead. “To what do we owe the…*pleasure*?”

I bared my teeth. “Humans do not wish to continue open relations? Have you forgotten what we did for you so soon?”

“We didn’t expect the Arxur back here, keeping tabs on us. I know a warship when I see one, and I certainly don’t like it gunning for Earth. Why do you feel entitled to roam our home system?”

“Because I’m Chief Hunter Isif. You know, the single reason your species is still alive today. The one who gave you an army, sent food to your cities, pulled your dying from the rubble, and traded you the Venlil.”

“…I see. My nation thanked you, and housed you. That doesn’t mean you’re going to lord your aid over humanity forever. You must use proper diplomatic channels, like everyone else.”

“I’ve gone through your channels, and received a dismissive statement from Zhao. That’s unacceptable. I’ve earned some gratitude, if not respect.”

“What are you going to do, sue us?”

Malice glimmered in General Jones’ eyes, and a defiant smirk tugged at her lips. Fury swelled in my chest, threatening to spill into a roar. I was able to contain it to a growl, but I couldn’t believe what ingrates the humans were. The United Nations hadn’t been this flippant with me in the past, even after Meier’s death.

*Why the sudden hostility? I came to help humanity, but now, I don’t know whether they deserve it.*

Perhaps there was some truth to Shaza’s claim that the Terrans needed a kick in the teeth. If she took their bold-faced antagonism down a notch, that would be beneficial to my goals. Earth’s government warranted a reminder of their precarious position. I was less certain that I could rely on their leaders than ever.

Still, humans were the only predators who wanted to end sapient farming. Their lab-grown meat had the power to feed us, and to weaken Betterment’s grip on Arxur society. Terrans must see reason again, when I reminded them we were on the same side. Meier understood how I defended humanity, and kept Giznel off their back.

Concerns still hounded me over the three Zurulians, hiding on my ship. I’d risked my cover on impulse, and I couldn’t have them die after ferrying them here. It was worth brushing off the insult, so that my defective voice would settle down. However, I’d like to hear General Jones issue an apology, down the line. Her contemptful look was grating at my patience.

“I’m your only ally in the Dominion. The intelligence I can offer you is worth your time,” I hissed.

The primate cleared her throat. “You have something you want to share? Then spit it out.”

“I’ll only speak to Zhao. I rule this entire sector: your sector. I directly interact with our government, and keep them off your backs. I deserve to look my equal in the eye, yes?”

“Well, tough luck. The Secretary-General is unavailable.”

“Then so am I. You haven’t even forwarded the request to him. If your leader can’t spare a minute on a call, I can’t be bothered to share my thoughts.”

“I said he’s unavailable. I will apprise Zhao of any intel you divulge to us.”

“I want a personal chat, human! Are you fucking dense?”

Jones slanted her eyebrows. “How dare—”

“How dare YOU!” I roared. “If it was important…if I was Tarva, Zhao would make time. Hell, Tarva *herself* was more diplomatic than you people!”

The UN fighters still coasted alongside me, and I barely refrained from target-locking them. I was mistaken to think of humanity as a friend; they would always consider us second-class to the prey. The option to storm off, and communicate with Venlil Prime instead, grew more appealing by the minute. If the Terrans hadn’t disrupted my FTL capabilities, I would’ve left in a huff.

There was no logical reason the humans would confront an Arxur ally, and spit in his face. Perhaps their vengeance had driven them mad; it was clear they were obsessed with Sol’s military defenses. Another possibility was that this American general was superseding the chain of command. She could be seeking to claim my intel for her nation alone.

Was that it? Was Jones shutting Zhao out of the loop, as a power play? Coups weren’t unheard of, back when unrest plagued Wriss; rulers could change by the week.

The drone mastermind might resent that she was snubbed for Secretary-General, in favor of a general from a rival state. Undermining Zhao’s regime would fashion the Americans as an appealing alternative. The ostensible status was that humans quieted all clannish tendencies, under threat of extinction. The United Nations supposedly helped them work together against aliens. But I wasn’t sure Earth’s tribes had laid old grudges to rest.

General Jones tapped a few buttons, before sitting in silence for a minute. “Be careful what you wish for, Isif. The Secretary-General will speak with you.”

I was a bit relieved that the American-led forces hadn’t done anything rash. Humans were bold enough to try to capture me, and convince me to talk through other means. From what I read on my holopad, their interrogation methods could surpass even Arxur creativity. If I’d shared those tidbits with Giznel, he’d respect their cruelty.

A human male appeared on screen, dressed in formal attire. His skin was warm and tan, while his hair was styled as a black crew cut. Forehead wrinkles indicated he was middle-aged, likely with several decades in the service. Anger oozed from his taut grimace; even his shoulders were forward, asserting dominance.

“Mr. Secretary-General, it’s an honor.” I forced a placid expression, and dipped my head. “I intended for us to meet much sooner. A shame, yes?”

Zhao’s expression didn’t change. “Well, you have my full attention now. I suppose that is what you wanted.”

“It is? That American general was stalling me from contacting you. I fear she may be watching out for her national interests, at your world’s expense.”

“General Jones and I have an understanding. National interests mean nothing, with human interests under constant threat. That threat is *extinction*, and it pays no mind to borders. We cannot afford squabbles.”

“But Jones would not pass along my call.”

“Because I told her not to. I was already listening the entire time, you know.”

My eyes narrowed with outrage, and I lashed my tail. This Secretary-General would blow me off, when I came to Sol to protect his forces? For pack predators with ubiquitous empathy, they had a lousy way of showing it. Who was I kidding, to think humans would help defective Arxur? Dominion rebellion meant nothing to their self-oriented agenda.

I knew Terrans still cared about the Venlil, like their own pack. The new Secretary-General also lauded the other races that aided Earth, yet sported contempt for the Arxur. Furthermore, they launched new ‘exchange programs’ with the Yotul and Zurulians, while welcoming defecting herbivores to their alliance. The ever-patient humans found the resolve to train the quaking prey! To my amazement, those efforts were getting results.

*Obligate carnivores just aren’t convenient to their new empire…is that it? Or maybe they cannot forgive our crimes…*

I gritted my teeth. “What have I ever done to you? I helped you and asked nothing in return. I could’ve conquered Earth, but I treated you as equals.”

“That’s the only reason I haven’t ordered Jones to capture you, Isif,” Zhao said. “With what we know today, you’re no friend of humanity. Listen carefully and tell your boss; we are not supporting agendas that go against our interests.”

“What are you talking about? Our interests are the same!”

“We both know that’s not true. You were adamant about Fahl and Sillis being glassed, and humanity following your every command. We are not your puppets.”

“What? You’ve gone mad, Zhao. The Dominion knows you are weak, and they won’t tolerate your interference. I’m trying to keep weak predators alive into the future!”

“Weak? We are not weak. We are young, and growing exponentially.”

I hissed in exasperation. “Then give yourselves time to grow. Fahl and Sillis do not help your…human first agenda, am I right?”

“It’s about the principle of encouraging our enemies to surrender. Besides, if we forked over the Tilfish and the Harchen worlds without a fight, it would cement this ‘human weakness’ in your minds. I will not set that precedent. The Arxur shall respect us.”

Secretary-General Zhao cast an unwavering glare at the screen. As much as I wanted to unload on him, my departure from Sol required humanity lifting their FTL disruptors. Securing a ride out might require groveling; politeness was mandatory for my request to leave. But at this point, I had no intent of passing along Shaza’s plans to Earth.

It felt like a betrayal, that the UN would dismiss my high-risk friendship with humanity. How could Terrans say our interests weren’t aligned, unless they were unwilling to help us? I thought we both sought a better future, and a change in the Arxur government. My defective voice wanted the hominids to like me, and accept me as one of their peers.

A delirious scream echoed behind me, and my head whipped around. One of the Zurulians had climbed atop a table, in the camera’s backdrop. It was the one who’d been crying in the cage, though she looked worse for wear. Her lips were dry from dehydration, and her eyes were half-closed with fatigue. I could see desperation glitter in her pupils.

“H-human! Help us…p-please,” she croaked, in a ragged voice.

The Secretary-General leaned forward in his chair, and his eyes widened with alarm. His jaw clenched shortly after, as he recognized the Zurulian’s paltry condition. While I appreciated that Zhao loathed our cattle practices, the quadrupeds’ deterioration wasn’t my fault. I’d risked my hide to rescue them, and I *had* provided for them. Was I supposed to flush them out at gunpoint, to drink water?

“So that’s why there are four life signatures on your ship.” The Terran’s voice was low and charged with fury. I noticed his hands typing at a holopad, likely communicating with Jones’ forces. “You’re using our friends as bargaining chips? You’d commit acts of terrorism in the Sol System?!”

I shook my head. “It’s not like that! I brought them here so you could send them home.”

“Yeah, right; conveniently forgot to mention their presence, huh? Is that your food for this week? Filthy croc.”

“That’s it! I will fucking rip you from limb-to-limb, you puny branch-swinger! I will carve out your itsy-bitsy canines…and embed them on my armor as a prize!”

“You won’t be doing anything. I was planning to catch-and-release you, but you’re better taken out of the equation. The United Nations will be bringing you into custody, Isif.”

I tried to attempt evasive maneuvers, but the UN blew out my propulsions with a single hit. My weapons system was malfunctioning, and I found the glitch rather coincidental. The Terran fighters flanking me used mechanisms to latch on to my hull seamlessly. Sparks flew behind me, as humans began breaching into the cabin. The Zurulians bounded up to the noise, yipping for aid.

The world took on a red hue, and anger overflowed into my consciousness. Feeling the need to attack something, I swung my claws at my dashboard. Electricity arced through the air, as I tore a chunk of metal out of the pedestal. Adrenaline led me to blindly throw the debris, and it nearly landed atop the Zurulians. Realizing I’d almost harmed them snapped me back to lucidity, though I was still steaming.

*Why is Zhao doing this? I was a valuable asset to him, from a logistical standpoint.*

The Secretary-General leaned in to another holopad. “This is a high-value prisoner. Bring him in, alive! I want to know what he knows.”

“You’re making a mistake!” I roared. “Why are you doing this?!”

“For one, you’ve learned too much about Earth’s revamps. The element of surprise is important, if worse comes to worst. An enemy Chief Hunter can’t ruin that for us.”

“Enemy? Meier knew I’m not your enemy. We want the same fucking thing, Zhao.”

“Meier was naïve. He couldn’t see an enemy if they were holding him at gunpoint.”

I curled my lip with disdain. “You don’t believe I’m an ally, just because I’m an Arxur.”

“No, I don’t believe you’re an ally, because we’ve…obtained Arxur reports. Including Shaza’s partial transcript of your visit.”

I leaned back on my haunches. Understanding dawned on me, as I realized that the United Nations had tapped into our communications network. Meier understood how I played things up for effect, but that knowledge hadn’t been passed on to his successor. Perhaps my acting was a bit too superb, if it fooled the very people I was protecting.

My offense over Terran aggression was gone, once there was some basis for their behavior. This was all a misunderstanding; it should be easy for me to clear things up. Of course Earth wouldn’t welcome someone who claimed to be using them in a war. It didn’t help that I insulted Zhao in my speech, though such rhetoric was tailored for a different audience.

“What is it you think that I said?” I hissed.

“‘I’m using humans to make the Dominion the supreme, unchallenged power.’ Oh, what about this one? ‘The UN are clueless to our aims, because Zhao is blind and on the warpath.’”

“You can’t take that at face value. Read between the lines! You’re intelligent. I was trying to talk Shaza down…she wants to nuke your prizes, with your forces still there.”

“We know that. And we know your rationale against an attack was ‘Not yet, save our strength.’”

A metallic section of the wall toppled inward, and Terran soldiers stalked inside. The primates almost tripped over the Zurulians, who ran toward their entry point. The humans rounded on me in formation, wearing goggles over their eyes. After a moment’s hesitation, I sunk to my knees and raised my paws in surrender.

“Why would you tell me you know all this? You’re tipping your hand,” I growled.

The Secretary-General sported a malevolent grin. “Because you’re never going to tell your people any of it.”

A dart embedded itself in my neck, and I plucked it out on instinct. My head felt a bit woozy, before I lost my balance. The humans crept closer, readying more sedatives in case the dosage was inadequate. My eyes fluttered, and my vision shrank to a pinhole. There was no hope of talking my way out of this situation…and it wasn’t the Dominion who did me in like I imagined.

My undoing was assisting alien predators, who never planned for me to leave the Sol system again.

The falsehood will raise further questions about the accuracy of search engines and of AI-generated answers to humans’ questions.

The NASA telescope was made operational in December 2021 and has been used by scientists to make several discoveries of new planets outside the Solar System.

One of the responses generated by Bard says: ""JWST took the very first pictures of a planet outside of our own solar system.""

# Super Short TL;DR - go go go go

^(Opinion / speculation warning)  
RC is back, he's the big buyer and he wants to take on Amazon. Icahn is part of the deal as well and through Icahn's omni channel of goods for BBBY and buybuy BABY, RC & company (Dragonfly) will be able to bring domestic, quality goods across multiple regions to be a legit competitor to Amazon. It'll start from GME, and we'll see where the Teddy takes us. Oops.. :D

# TL;DR:

We all ~~suspect~~ know a merge and acquisition is coming. Plenty of great minds have been thinking about it and speculating for months on this.  Just paying dues to people I saw who wrote it before me (but I had my own thoughts before reading theirs). 

[www.reddit.com/r/BBBY/comments/wtfwyp/potential\_bbby\_endgame\_a\_wombo\_combo\_of\_dragonfly/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BBBY/comments/wtfwyp/potential_bbby_endgame_a_wombo_combo_of_dragonfly/)

[www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wr43d5/bbby\_a\_timeline\_of\_interesting\_events\_is\_it\_clear/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wr43d5/bbby_a_timeline_of_interesting_events_is_it_clear/)

What most people haven't focused on, is ***how long*** a merge and acquisition process takes to complete. That's why the dates projected thus far, have turned out to be wrong. At minimum, a M&A process takes 6 months. If it's a very complicated one, it can take years. I don't personally believe an M&A for BBBY is actually that complicated at this point. There's a lot of funny stuff going on that makes it look complicated, but behind the scenes, I think it's pretty straight forward.

Because of this, I believe when RC sent in that letter back in March of 2022, it was with the intent to seriously consider BBBY for an **acquisition from the start**. He got his representation on the board to identify the true value, so that he may identify if he could make the commitment. March 25th 2022 is when those members were added to the board. I believe they had 2 objectives: 

1. Gain the confidence of the internal board and shareholders to be voted in at the annual share holders meeting
2. Identify true value of BBBY as a whole, based on it's biggest asset in Buy Buy Baby. 

We know the board members were all successfully voted in on July 14th 2022 when the annual share holders meeting took place. We also know the removal of Tritton as CEO took place June 29th. I believe between the 29th of June to the 14th of July was establishing the interim CEO setup (Sue Gove). Once the 14th hit and the announcements made, I believe there was a 1 month operation to discuss the action plan to acquire BBBY. **It was at** ***this*** **moment, RC was committed to conducting an M&A.**

RC would go on to sell his shares a month after the 14th of July, on Aug 16th and 17th as he wouldn't be able to conduct an M&A if he had shares in BBBY when he makes an offer - conflict of interest and outlined in the standstill provisions. **Fun fact**: 6 months from these dates would be Feb 16th / 17th; O.o

# Timeline- Episode 6: Return of the Senpai

Full timeline of events with links to stuff. Had to do this because I was running into post character limits.

[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Woum8vCKXF\_oKdO0C\_Osa6A6ROz8Q6sU\_uJ\_3jYohRs/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Woum8vCKXF_oKdO0C_Osa6A6ROz8Q6sU_uJ_3jYohRs/edit?usp=sharing)

January was crazy and since then we have had 3x 8-K filings in February (it's only Feb 8 btw) and a few other specialty based filings. I'm not going to list them because those events are still unfolding but we have enough information to go about the thesis here. If you'd like to check out filings further: [bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/financial-information/sec-filings?items\_per\_page=10&page=0](https://bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/financial-information/sec-filings?items_per_page=10&page=0)

The important thing to take away from the February filings: 

* Feb 7th BBBY released this 8-K, where they confirm receipt of $225 million from the preferred share exchange
   * Sauce: [bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/node/16971/html](https://bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/node/16971/html)
   * Under section **Item 8.01 Other Events**, Paragraph 2, First sentence:
      * "" The Offering was consummated on February 7, 2023 (the “Closing Date”). **The Company received gross proceeds of approximately $225 million on the Closing Date** and **may receive** up to an additional approximately **$800 million** of gross proceeds in subsequent closings **over up to ten months**, subject to certain **conditions** to the receipt of the proceeds by the Company at each applicable closing, including that the Company’s common **stock shall remain listed** on a national securities exchange, that the **Company has sufficient authorized common stock** to issue the shares subject to such closing, that the **Company has not filed for bankruptcy protection** and that, to the extent the Company is **in default under its material indebtedness, the Company has a valid and enforceable forbearance agreement**. As such the Company cannot give any assurance that it will receive all of the proceeds of the Offering.  ""

I'll explain this a little more in the deep dive.

Now, if you got lost at any point in all of that, *you are forgiven****. That,*** might be one of the most roller coaster ride experiences I've ever tracked with a company. Considering all the while the company is also getting shorted to death.  Anyways, time to eat the massive cake piece we just carved out.

# Deep Dive

Now what does it all really mean? There is ***SO MUCH*** going on here that without seeing the bigger picture, you wouldn't get the conclusion we have today. Remember in my previous DD's I mentioned that we evaluate companies ***over time*** through a state ***in time***. Well when you focus on just 1 report, that's the ***in time*** statements. The problem with only focusing on those points, while they are factual, they don't deliver the hidden meanings underneath. You need to be connecting the dots **o*****ver time*** in order to truly understand what a company is doing.

So let's dive in to each of the pieces, and understand ***why*** they played out the way they did.

# RC's letter to the board:

On the surface, many saw RC reach out to BBBY and identify it as a means that he was focused on buybuy BABY. It's easy for people to misunderstand that intention, given the letter does explicitly relate everything to BABY. However, when you read information around the standstill, which is later released that same month, AND you identify the actions over time by the board and RC himself, it's clear that RC wanted all of BBBY, not just BABY.

How can we tell? Well here's the standstill again: [www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/886158/000092189522000972/ex991to13da113351002\_032422.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/886158/000092189522000972/ex991to13da113351002_032422.htm)

Have a look at page 3, clause (b) Board Committee, item (i):

>Immediately following the execution of this Agreement, Ms. Bowen and Mr. Rosenzweig shall be appointed to serve as members of the Strategy Committee of the Board (the “Strategy Committee”), which committee has been created with an agreed upon charter to **support the Board’s oversight and review of a strategic analysis of the buybuy BABY business**. During the Standstill Period, the Strategy Committee shall consist of four (4) independent directors (including at least two (2) New Directors or Replacement Directors). **Sue Gove shall be the initial chair of the Strategy Committee**; provided, that in the event Ms. Gove is subsequently unable or unwilling to serve as the chair of the Strategy Committee, the replacement chair of the Strategy Committee shall be selected by the full Board. 

&#x200B;

[\\""But wrinkly ape, that dere says analysis of the buybuy BABY business?\\""](https://preview.redd.it/z6yy6hehvzga1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=db2fc9417a613243a5dedc3b7f0cbf7f049a73a7)

So ***yes***, RC did want to understand the value of BBBY as a whole. He just disguised it under the branch of BABY because that was easy to focus on. I mean, who wouldn't want the ""diamond in the rough"" of a ""dying"" company? This was a trap to have MSM and shorts focus on what they ***thought*** RC wanted, and they rationalized it because it's what greedy investors like them would go for in the same circumstance.

>Mr. Cohen concluded: “The resolution announced today represents a positive outcome for all of Bed Bath’s shareholders. By refreshing the Board with shareholder-designated individuals who possess capital markets acumen and transaction experience, the Company is well-positioned to review alternatives for buybuy BABY. I appreciate that management and the Board were willing to promptly embrace our ideas and look forward to supporting them in the year ahead.”  (Exhibit A, Page 2, Paragraph 1, 1st sentence)

# Annual Shareholders Meeting

https://preview.redd.it/f68qnm7fvzga1.png?width=670&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=093e140c39b692ed041b3e889b9dade99fbd5315

[materials.proxyvote.com/Approved/075896/20220516/SUP\_511504.PDF](https://materials.proxyvote.com/Approved/075896/20220516/SUP_511504.PDF)

It shows you that Tritton resigned, just after the proxy vote but before the annual share holders meeting. 

>Mr. Tritton’s separation was not the result of any disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to the Company’s operations, policies or practices. 

With the statement above implied, it means the votes came in and people didn't want Tritton to stick around. ***And why would they? He was driving the company into the ground.***

Want proof? Read this 8-K again: [bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/node/16191/html](https://bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/node/16191/html)

*What I find very interesting*, is how the number of votes for each of the 3 members RC brought on the board, are all around the same amount of votes against. This is looking in comparison to the other board members and how dispersed their vote tallies are. **That's very interesting.**

So anyways, pat yourselves on the back, you got Tritton removed, not RC.

I do want to draw attention while we're here to 1 more thing:

[materials.proxyvote.com/Approved/075896/20220516/COMBO\_508900.PDF](https://materials.proxyvote.com/Approved/075896/20220516/COMBO_508900.PDF) 

Take note of page 74 and how BlackRock has a 20.7% ownership into the company. Interesting how that decreased based on their January 2023 13G filings, to somewhere around 14%. Just thought I'd point out given the events in January.

With Tritton now removed and the company likely working towards an interim CEO, RC could proceed with his actual plan for BBBY. That's what makes the next segment so ***intriguing.***

# The Jake Freeman Saga

# Bonds of Endless Time

So after the Jake Freeman stuff, we had the unfortunate passing of Gustavo Arnal and the Q2 shareholders meeting. They weren't overly interesting, but RC did finally speak out during his GMEdd interview on why he sold BBBY.... sort of. ***If you're like me***, you read into the way he delivers his answer on that subject, and **you can tell** **there's something else up**. Anyways, check out the interview and judge for yourself, listed in the timeline (November time frame).

We then jump into the bonds of endless time segment, where we see a bond exchange offering take place and.... extend. And extend again. And is extended a *third* time?... ¿***fourth*** time?... and eventually is ***cancelled***...? ok ***wtf*** is going on here?!

Again, I'm not a bonds guy and there's no reason for me to draft up anything on that. Here's your guy and his DD:  [u/BiggySmallzzz](https://www.reddit.com/u/BiggySmallzzz/)

Fascinating development and we'll see if this plays a role in the months to come. My suspicion here is BBBY is going to pay most of their debts after the M&A process, enough to not have a claim to sell any of it's assets for creditors. Then the bond holders might get screwed holding the bag, all because they didn't want to take deals. I know this isn't true about all bond holders, as some advanced retail traders are in that list and did accept the offering. However it's just an interesting, *speculative* thought.

I could be wrong on that mindset, those are my speculations of course but I just find it interesting how that might work. And if that wasn't enough, remember this 8-K filing on Feb 6th:

[bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/node/16936/html](https://bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/node/16936/html)

>***Trading in our securities is highly speculative, and we may be required to file for bankruptcy protection even if the Transactions are fully consummated.***   
Page 3, 3rd paragraph

Now why would an offering go through, and yet a bankruptcy filing still take place? Well if you are closing down the one company via means of merging it into another, AND you need to separate the financials going forward - well that's why :)

BBBY will merge with GME into a bigger name. Start placing your bets now on which lol :D

# Delinquency and a Teenage Wasteland with Harriet the Spy:

&#x200B;

[The who? Seriously, wtf did I just read?](https://preview.redd.it/19n0uupwuzga1.png?width=278&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1745bcb3eacbe1aedc8beeb6aa101adc45b4e5ab)

January 2023 has by far been an interesting time. There's a lot of important things to take from last month, particularly the fact that BBBY put themselves in a state of delinquency. Now it can't be proven to be true but the **suspicion** here is that was ***intentional***. That is, BBBY wanted to interrupt certain operations relating to it's ticker based on the rules of the NASDAQ on delinquentcies, which they could trigger by not filing their 10-Q on time.

[listingcenter.nasdaq.com/rulebook/nasdaq/rules/Nasdaq%205800%20Series](https://listingcenter.nasdaq.com/rulebook/nasdaq/rules/Nasdaq%205800%20Series)

What the blockage of doing such an action are, I couldn't find the exact terms. But I think it certainly is plausible to suggest being in a delinquent state would fuck with the 2 year swap process for... *shady* practicing firms. ***Just a hunch.***

One of the other great things outlined from the month, was actually early in the month during their shareholders presentation. This was their released content for Jan 10th. Pay attention to the Q3 highlights section: [bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/static-files/22b00a90-df18-456e-898d-8929e88dc7fc](https://bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/static-files/22b00a90-df18-456e-898d-8929e88dc7fc)  


>\- Initiated incremental cost reductions of approximately $80 million to $100 million across corporate, including overhead expense and headcount, to align with current business  
>  
>\- Additional $80 million to $100 million savings opportunity identified across supply chain that will also improve cost to serve and time to deliver for our customers

It is ***extremely convenient*** that the cost reduction associated to headcount, overhead expenses and corporate expenditures lined up with the exact amount of cost saving opportunities associated across the supply chain, that will ***specifically improve cost to serve and time to deliver*** to customers.

Reading between the lines here: BBBY is merging their operations of distribution with another company. The result is half the overhead across the board for all implications of that process. **Gee, I wonder who it is?**

^(Just going to put this here:) [www.costar.com/article/2126390201/gamestop-gets-ready-to-close-one-of-its-us-distribution-hubs](https://www.costar.com/article/2126390201/gamestop-gets-ready-to-close-one-of-its-us-distribution-hubs)

**Side note:** I find it **incredibly intriguing** that no other major ""wallstreet"" MSM content creator really highlighted the above. Wonder why that is? I ***also*** wonder why GME would be closing down a distribution center?

This thread might be interesting to you: [www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/10fnkcj/rip\_to\_the\_whole\_gamestop\_fulfillment\_center\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/10fnkcj/rip_to_the_whole_gamestop_fulfillment_center_in/)

A comment highlights that the people laid off represent $30 million in cost savings alone. Not proven fact but - it's all just interesting :)

Ok so that was the delinquency and the wasteland. Highly recommend looking at the lyrics of that song btw ( Baba O'Riley by The Who).  So what about Harriet the spy?

*Ah yes*, ***that*** ***part*** of the saga. *Bet you didn't know this one:* [*www.imdb.com/title/tt0116493/*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116493/)

>Harriet M. Welsch is a spy. But when her friends find her secret notebook, the tables are turned on her. Can she win them back and still keep on going with the spy business?

It's not a 100% 1 for 1 but like... ***kind of? Okay***, I'm stretching the title in this section a *little*. Give me a break, I'm content generating here. Remember, **redemption.**

I'd be lying if this all didn't feel like a season of Dragon Ball Z and it's endless buildups to complicated double crosses, only to see our hero return time and time again: stronger, faster and ready to kick ass.... wait a minute..

To put it in the words of a legal friend:

>Didn’t get a chance to dig into this yesterday. But yeah it looks like the plaintiffs are pretty sloppy. The dismissal of JPM is probably without prejudice. Just means that the plaintiffs don’t want to proceed against JPM right now. 

So basically, this suit is dicking around and is by extension **intentionally delaying the M&A transaction.**

Whoever is *fucked* from shorting this company, ***REALLY*** *doesn't want to have to close.*

# Becoming a Senpai Master

And so we finally come to this month, February 2023. We have seen some interesting developments, followed by a lot of BBBY SEC filings, but none giving us quite the release we're hoping for yet. However we have one important SEC filing that I think people should pay attention to, this 8-K:

[bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/node/16971/html](https://bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/node/16971/html)

>Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities: $1,042.1

And you know... it's funny because someone literally just filed a 13G/A, that's right an amendment, from their December 31st 2022 filing... for GME. Like, literally ***yesterday Feb 7th***. 

What's the change you ask? **Sole Voting Power**

Wonder who it could be? [news.gamestop.com/node/19951/html](https://news.gamestop.com/node/19951/html) 

Now why on earth, would BR need voting rights for GME? Well... if you're doing an M&A where you're offering equity over 20% of the value of the purchase, then the acquiring company shareholders need to vote on the action. 

You know what's also funny? **Dumb** **stormtroopers**

It's great when they show us their hand by relaying it to the media:

[www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/long-ideas/23/01/30463393/bed-bath-beyond-surges-higher-in-this-key-trend-whats-going-on](https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/long-ideas/23/01/30463393/bed-bath-beyond-surges-higher-in-this-key-trend-whats-going-on)

> If Bed Bath & Beyond breaks up from the downward sloping flag formation on higher-than-average volume, the measured move indicates the stock could surge up toward $15. 

That means, shorts and MSM, whom I have a high suspicion includes BR among the ranks, believe that the BBBY acquisition cost would be more than $15 cash. If you also included it as part of, say, a GME share value at $19? That means your offer for BBBY purchase would be around $34 per share.

I wonder where I've seen numbers like that before on price estimates... :/ hmmm [www.reddit.com/r/BBBY/comments/zekf9v/dd\_on\_price\_action\_scenarios\_bear\_cases\_and\_how/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BBBY/comments/zekf9v/dd_on_price_action_scenarios_bear_cases_and_how/) 

According to BBBY's Q3 10-Q released on Jan 26th, the outstanding share count was 117,321,914. At $34 per share value, that's a corporate valuation of $3,988,945,076, or in other words $4 billion dollars rounded. **Interesting.**

Want more interesting? That share count \* $15 = $1,759,828,710. If GME covers $1.042 billion of that...

$1,759,828,710 - $1,042,000,000 =  $717,828,710 left to cover in cash. 

That's a pretty close number to this: [twitter.com/larryvc/status/1618710463264735233](https://twitter.com/larryvc/status/1618710463264735233)

$717,828,710 - $675,000,000 = $42,828,710

Didn't the recent Feb BBBY filings also mention they renegotiated the debt and had been given $100 million from the FILO ?

# Super Short TL;DR - go go go go

^(Opinion / speculation warning)  
RC is back, he's the big buyer and he wants to take on Amazon. Icahn is part of the deal as well and through Icahn's omni channel of goods for BBBY and buybuy BABY, RC & company (Dragonfly) will be able to bring domestic, quality goods across multiple regions to be a legit competitor to Amazon. It'll start from GME, and we'll see where the Teddy takes us. Oops.. :D

# TL;DR:

We all ~~suspect~~ know a merge and acquisition is coming. Plenty of great minds have been thinking about it and speculating for months on this.  Just paying dues to people I saw who wrote it before me (but I had my own thoughts before reading theirs). 

[www.reddit.com/r/BBBY/comments/wtfwyp/potential\_bbby\_endgame\_a\_wombo\_combo\_of\_dragonfly/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BBBY/comments/wtfwyp/potential_bbby_endgame_a_wombo_combo_of_dragonfly/)

[www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wr43d5/bbby\_a\_timeline\_of\_interesting\_events\_is\_it\_clear/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wr43d5/bbby_a_timeline_of_interesting_events_is_it_clear/)

What most people haven't focused on, is ***how long*** a merge and acquisition process takes to complete. That's why the dates projected thus far, have turned out to be wrong. At minimum, a M&A process takes 6 months. If it's a very complicated one, it can take years. I don't personally believe an M&A for BBBY is actually that complicated at this point. There's a lot of funny stuff going on that makes it look complicated, but behind the scenes, I think it's pretty straight forward.

Because of this, I believe when RC sent in that letter back in March of 2022, it was with the intent to seriously consider BBBY for an **acquisition from the start**. He got his representation on the board to identify the true value, so that he may identify if he could make the commitment. March 25th 2022 is when those members were added to the board. I believe they had 2 objectives: 

1. Gain the confidence of the internal board and shareholders to be voted in at the annual share holders meeting
2. Identify true value of BBBY as a whole, based on it's biggest asset in Buy Buy Baby. 

We know the board members were all successfully voted in on July 14th 2022 when the annual share holders meeting took place. We also know the removal of Tritton as CEO took place June 29th. I believe between the 29th of June to the 14th of July was establishing the interim CEO setup (Sue Gove). Once the 14th hit and the announcements made, I believe there was a 1 month operation to discuss the action plan to acquire BBBY. **It was at** ***this*** **moment, RC was committed to conducting an M&A.**

RC would go on to sell his shares a month after the 14th of July, on Aug 16th and 17th as he wouldn't be able to conduct an M&A if he had shares in BBBY when he makes an offer - conflict of interest and outlined in the standstill provisions. **Fun fact**: 6 months from these dates would be Feb 16th / 17th; O.o

# Timeline- Episode 6: Return of the Senpai

Full timeline of events with links to stuff. Had to do this because I was running into post character limits.

[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Woum8vCKXF\_oKdO0C\_Osa6A6ROz8Q6sU\_uJ\_3jYohRs/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Woum8vCKXF_oKdO0C_Osa6A6ROz8Q6sU_uJ_3jYohRs/edit?usp=sharing)

January was crazy and since then we have had 3x 8-K filings in February (it's only Feb 8 btw) and a few other specialty based filings. I'm not going to list them because those events are still unfolding but we have enough information to go about the thesis here. If you'd like to check out filings further: [bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/financial-information/sec-filings?items\_per\_page=10&page=0](https://bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/financial-information/sec-filings?items_per_page=10&page=0)

The important thing to take away from the February filings: 

* Feb 7th BBBY released this 8-K, where they confirm receipt of $225 million from the preferred share exchange
   * Sauce: [bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/node/16971/html](https://bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/node/16971/html)
   * Under section **Item 8.01 Other Events**, Paragraph 2, First sentence:
      * "" The Offering was consummated on February 7, 2023 (the “Closing Date”). **The Company received gross proceeds of approximately $225 million on the Closing Date** and **may receive** up to an additional approximately **$800 million** of gross proceeds in subsequent closings **over up to ten months**, subject to certain **conditions** to the receipt of the proceeds by the Company at each applicable closing, including that the Company’s common **stock shall remain listed** on a national securities exchange, that the **Company has sufficient authorized common stock** to issue the shares subject to such closing, that the **Company has not filed for bankruptcy protection** and that, to the extent the Company is **in default under its material indebtedness, the Company has a valid and enforceable forbearance agreement**. As such the Company cannot give any assurance that it will receive all of the proceeds of the Offering.  ""

I'll explain this a little more in the deep dive.

Now, if you got lost at any point in all of that, *you are forgiven****. That,*** might be one of the most roller coaster ride experiences I've ever tracked with a company. Considering all the while the company is also getting shorted to death.  Anyways, time to eat the massive cake piece we just carved out.

# Deep Dive

Now what does it all really mean? There is ***SO MUCH*** going on here that without seeing the bigger picture, you wouldn't get the conclusion we have today. Remember in my previous DD's I mentioned that we evaluate companies ***over time*** through a state ***in time***. Well when you focus on just 1 report, that's the ***in time*** statements. The problem with only focusing on those points, while they are factual, they don't deliver the hidden meanings underneath. You need to be connecting the dots **o*****ver time*** in order to truly understand what a company is doing.

So let's dive in to each of the pieces, and understand ***why*** they played out the way they did.

# RC's letter to the board:

On the surface, many saw RC reach out to BBBY and identify it as a means that he was focused on buybuy BABY. It's easy for people to misunderstand that intention, given the letter does explicitly relate everything to BABY. However, when you read information around the standstill, which is later released that same month, AND you identify the actions over time by the board and RC himself, it's clear that RC wanted all of BBBY, not just BABY.

How can we tell? Well here's the standstill again: [www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/886158/000092189522000972/ex991to13da113351002\_032422.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/886158/000092189522000972/ex991to13da113351002_032422.htm)

Have a look at page 3, clause (b) Board Committee, item (i):

>Immediately following the execution of this Agreement, Ms. Bowen and Mr. Rosenzweig shall be appointed to serve as members of the Strategy Committee of the Board (the “Strategy Committee”), which committee has been created with an agreed upon charter to **support the Board’s oversight and review of a strategic analysis of the buybuy BABY business**. During the Standstill Period, the Strategy Committee shall consist of four (4) independent directors (including at least two (2) New Directors or Replacement Directors). **Sue Gove shall be the initial chair of the Strategy Committee**; provided, that in the event Ms. Gove is subsequently unable or unwilling to serve as the chair of the Strategy Committee, the replacement chair of the Strategy Committee shall be selected by the full Board. 

&#x200B;

[\\""But wrinkly ape, that dere says analysis of the buybuy BABY business?\\""](https://preview.redd.it/z6yy6hehvzga1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=db2fc9417a613243a5dedc3b7f0cbf7f049a73a7)

So ***yes***, RC did want to understand the value of BBBY as a whole. He just disguised it under the branch of BABY because that was easy to focus on. I mean, who wouldn't want the ""diamond in the rough"" of a ""dying"" company? This was a trap to have MSM and shorts focus on what they ***thought*** RC wanted, and they rationalized it because it's what greedy investors like them would go for in the same circumstance.

>Mr. Cohen concluded: “The resolution announced today represents a positive outcome for all of Bed Bath’s shareholders. By refreshing the Board with shareholder-designated individuals who possess capital markets acumen and transaction experience, the Company is well-positioned to review alternatives for buybuy BABY. I appreciate that management and the Board were willing to promptly embrace our ideas and look forward to supporting them in the year ahead.”  (Exhibit A, Page 2, Paragraph 1, 1st sentence)

# Annual Shareholders Meeting

https://preview.redd.it/f68qnm7fvzga1.png?width=670&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=093e140c39b692ed041b3e889b9dade99fbd5315

It shows you that Tritton resigned, just after the proxy vote but before the annual share holders meeting. 

>Mr. Tritton’s separation was not the result of any disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to the Company’s operations, policies or practices. 

With the statement above implied, it means the votes came in and people didn't want Tritton to stick around. ***And why would they? He was driving the company into the ground.***

Want proof? Read this 8-K again: [bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/node/16191/html](https://bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/node/16191/html)

*What I find very interesting*, is how the number of votes for each of the 3 members RC brought on the board, are all around the same amount of votes against. This is looking in comparison to the other board members and how dispersed their vote tallies are. **That's very interesting.**

So anyways, pat yourselves on the back, you got Tritton removed, not RC.

I do want to draw attention while we're here to 1 more thing:

[materials.proxyvote.com/Approved/075896/20220516/COMBO\_508900.PDF](https://materials.proxyvote.com/Approved/075896/20220516/COMBO_508900.PDF) 

Take note of page 74 and how BlackRock has a 20.7% ownership into the company. Interesting how that decreased based on their January 2023 13G filings, to somewhere around 14%. Just thought I'd point out given the events in January.

With Tritton now removed and the company likely working towards an interim CEO, RC could proceed with his actual plan for BBBY. That's what makes the next segment so ***intriguing.***

# Bonds of Endless Time

So after the Jake Freeman stuff, we had the unfortunate passing of Gustavo Arnal and the Q2 shareholders meeting. They weren't overly interesting, but RC did finally speak out during his GMEdd interview on why he sold BBBY.... sort of. ***If you're like me***, you read into the way he delivers his answer on that subject, and **you can tell** **there's something else up**. Anyways, check out the interview and judge for yourself, listed in the timeline (November time frame).

We then jump into the bonds of endless time segment, where we see a bond exchange offering take place and.... extend. And extend again. And is extended a *third* time?... ¿***fourth*** time?... and eventually is ***cancelled***...? ok ***wtf*** is going on here?!

Again, I'm not a bonds guy and there's no reason for me to draft up anything on that. Here's your guy and his DD:  [u/BiggySmallzzz](https://www.reddit.com/u/BiggySmallzzz/)

Fascinating development and we'll see if this plays a role in the months to come. My suspicion here is BBBY is going to pay most of their debts after the M&A process, enough to not have a claim to sell any of it's assets for creditors. Then the bond holders might get screwed holding the bag, all because they didn't want to take deals. I know this isn't true about all bond holders, as some advanced retail traders are in that list and did accept the offering. However it's just an interesting, *speculative* thought.

I could be wrong on that mindset, those are my speculations of course but I just find it interesting how that might work. And if that wasn't enough, remember this 8-K filing on Feb 6th:

[bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/node/16936/html](https://bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/node/16936/html)

>***Trading in our securities is highly speculative, and we may be required to file for bankruptcy protection even if the Transactions are fully consummated.***   
Page 3, 3rd paragraph

Now why would an offering go through, and yet a bankruptcy filing still take place? Well if you are closing down the one company via means of merging it into another, AND you need to separate the financials going forward - well that's why :)

BBBY will merge with GME into a bigger name. Start placing your bets now on which lol :D

# Delinquency and a Teenage Wasteland with Harriet the Spy:

&#x200B;

[The who? Seriously, wtf did I just read?](https://preview.redd.it/19n0uupwuzga1.png?width=278&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1745bcb3eacbe1aedc8beeb6aa101adc45b4e5ab)

January 2023 has by far been an interesting time. There's a lot of important things to take from last month, particularly the fact that BBBY put themselves in a state of delinquency. Now it can't be proven to be true but the **suspicion** here is that was ***intentional***. That is, BBBY wanted to interrupt certain operations relating to it's ticker based on the rules of the NASDAQ on delinquentcies, which they could trigger by not filing their 10-Q on time.

[listingcenter.nasdaq.com/rulebook/nasdaq/rules/Nasdaq%205800%20Series](https://listingcenter.nasdaq.com/rulebook/nasdaq/rules/Nasdaq%205800%20Series)

What the blockage of doing such an action are, I couldn't find the exact terms. But I think it certainly is plausible to suggest being in a delinquent state would fuck with the 2 year swap process for... *shady* practicing firms. ***Just a hunch.***

One of the other great things outlined from the month, was actually early in the month during their shareholders presentation. This was their released content for Jan 10th. Pay attention to the Q3 highlights section: [bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/static-files/22b00a90-df18-456e-898d-8929e88dc7fc](https://bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/static-files/22b00a90-df18-456e-898d-8929e88dc7fc)  


>\- Initiated incremental cost reductions of approximately $80 million to $100 million across corporate, including overhead expense and headcount, to align with current business  
>  
>\- Additional $80 million to $100 million savings opportunity identified across supply chain that will also improve cost to serve and time to deliver for our customers

It is ***extremely convenient*** that the cost reduction associated to headcount, overhead expenses and corporate expenditures lined up with the exact amount of cost saving opportunities associated across the supply chain, that will ***specifically improve cost to serve and time to deliver*** to customers.

Reading between the lines here: BBBY is merging their operations of distribution with another company. The result is half the overhead across the board for all implications of that process. **Gee, I wonder who it is?**

^(Just going to put this here:) [www.costar.com/article/2126390201/gamestop-gets-ready-to-close-one-of-its-us-distribution-hubs](https://www.costar.com/article/2126390201/gamestop-gets-ready-to-close-one-of-its-us-distribution-hubs)

**Side note:** I find it **incredibly intriguing** that no other major ""wallstreet"" MSM content creator really highlighted the above. Wonder why that is? I ***also*** wonder why GME would be closing down a distribution center?

This thread might be interesting to you: [www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/10fnkcj/rip\_to\_the\_whole\_gamestop\_fulfillment\_center\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/10fnkcj/rip_to_the_whole_gamestop_fulfillment_center_in/)

A comment highlights that the people laid off represent $30 million in cost savings alone. Not proven fact but - it's all just interesting :)

Ok so that was the delinquency and the wasteland. Highly recommend looking at the lyrics of that song btw ( Baba O'Riley by The Who).  So what about Harriet the spy?

*Ah yes*, ***that*** ***part*** of the saga. *Bet you didn't know this one:* [*www.imdb.com/title/tt0116493/*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116493/)

>Harriet M. Welsch is a spy. But when her friends find her secret notebook, the tables are turned on her. Can she win them back and still keep on going with the spy business?

It's not a 100% 1 for 1 but like... ***kind of? Okay***, I'm stretching the title in this section a *little*. Give me a break, I'm content generating here. Remember, **redemption.**

I'd be lying if this all didn't feel like a season of Dragon Ball Z and it's endless buildups to complicated double crosses, only to see our hero return time and time again: stronger, faster and ready to kick ass.... wait a minute..

To put it in the words of a legal friend:

>Didn’t get a chance to dig into this yesterday. But yeah it looks like the plaintiffs are pretty sloppy. The dismissal of JPM is probably without prejudice. Just means that the plaintiffs don’t want to proceed against JPM right now. 

So basically, this suit is dicking around and is by extension **intentionally delaying the M&A transaction.**

Whoever is *fucked* from shorting this company, ***REALLY*** *doesn't want to have to close.*

# Becoming a Senpai Master

And so we finally come to this month, February 2023. We have seen some interesting developments, followed by a lot of BBBY SEC filings, but none giving us quite the release we're hoping for yet. However we have one important SEC filing that I think people should pay attention to, this 8-K:

[bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/node/16971/html](https://bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/node/16971/html)

https://preview.redd.it/4vy7al0muzga1.png?width=666&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2d3a29f53a60acca421e263873904519a61956b0

[news.gamestop.com/node/19946/html](https://news.gamestop.com/node/19946/html) \- Page 17

>Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities: $1,042.1

And you know... it's funny because someone literally just filed a 13G/A, that's right an amendment, from their December 31st 2022 filing... for GME. Like, literally ***yesterday Feb 7th***. 

What's the change you ask? **Sole Voting Power**

Wonder who it could be? [news.gamestop.com/node/19951/html](https://news.gamestop.com/node/19951/html) 

Now why on earth, would BR need voting rights for GME? Well... if you're doing an M&A where you're offering equity over 20% of the value of the purchase, then the acquiring company shareholders need to vote on the action. 

You know what's also funny? **Dumb** **stormtroopers**

It's great when they show us their hand by relaying it to the media:

[www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/long-ideas/23/01/30463393/bed-bath-beyond-surges-higher-in-this-key-trend-whats-going-on](https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/long-ideas/23/01/30463393/bed-bath-beyond-surges-higher-in-this-key-trend-whats-going-on)

> If Bed Bath & Beyond breaks up from the downward sloping flag formation on higher-than-average volume, the measured move indicates the stock could surge up toward $15. 

That means, shorts and MSM, whom I have a high suspicion includes BR among the ranks, believe that the BBBY acquisition cost would be more than $15 cash. If you also included it as part of, say, a GME share value at $19? That means your offer for BBBY purchase would be around $34 per share.

I wonder where I've seen numbers like that before on price estimates... :/ hmmm [www.reddit.com/r/BBBY/comments/zekf9v/dd\_on\_price\_action\_scenarios\_bear\_cases\_and\_how/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BBBY/comments/zekf9v/dd_on_price_action_scenarios_bear_cases_and_how/) 

According to BBBY's Q3 10-Q released on Jan 26th, the outstanding share count was 117,321,914. At $34 per share value, that's a corporate valuation of $3,988,945,076, or in other words $4 billion dollars rounded. **Interesting.**

Want more interesting? That share count \* $15 = $1,759,828,710. If GME covers $1.042 billion of that...

$1,759,828,710 - $1,042,000,000 =  $717,828,710 left to cover in cash. 

That's a pretty close number to this: [twitter.com/larryvc/status/1618710463264735233](https://twitter.com/larryvc/status/1618710463264735233)

$717,828,710 - $675,000,000 = $42,828,710

Didn't the recent Feb BBBY filings also mention they renegotiated the debt and had been given $100 million from the FILO ?

***Why yes, yes it did....***

[bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/node/16971/html](https://bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/node/16971/html)

>The Amendment (i) decreased the total revolving commitment from $1.13 billion to $565 million, (ii) result in an outstanding principal amount of $428,897,500 as a result of the call protection being capitalized as principal to the Initial FILO Loan **and (iii) provide for an additional $100 million of FILO loans** (the “New FILO Loan” and together with the Initial FILO Loan, the “FILO Facility”, and together with the ABL Facility, the “Credit Facilities”), as well as other amendments

22,TIFU by giving my eyes 2nd degree burns,"This happened about 2 years ago, but I think it’s high time I tell my most shameful work story. 

So I’m a cook, working the sauté station on a weekday night.I have glasses but think they make me look dorky so I don’t wear them often. Took a steak in a pan out of the oven and worked it on the stove top for a minute before transferring the steak to a cutting board to rest. About a minute later my chef tells me the pan is on fire (because i had forgotten to turn off the burner) and the pan is in flames with all the oil/steak fat. 

I respond immediately by taking the first pan in sight, which happened to be the stack fresh from the dish pit.  Since the bottom of the pan was wet, (usually smothering a fire like this foolproof) the water on the bottom met with the oil and vaporized. The edge of the pans perfectly lined up to hit just my eyes, vigilante mask style. It was horrible. Thankfully didn’t scream, but jesus did that hurt. 

My chef saw and immediately ran to the dish pit to fill a huge bowl of cool clean water, then dragged my ass there and dunked my head in telling me to blink for a solid minute (thank you chef) After about 10 minutes of the saline wash we had at work and the amount of pain I got a ride to the hospital. 

So got to the ER and got both eyeballs flushed with a liter of saline each, which involved me being strapped to a table inverted so my feet were in the air and my face was by the ground with thick ass plastic bitches in my eyes to give the saline wash. 
(Bonus points cos the basin to catch the saline got fucked up and spilled it all over he floor, and when the cleaning guy came in, just looked at me with a mixture of fear anxiety and hope asked “is that water?”)

Got transferred to another hospital because it was 11 or so at that point and I needed to see an eye specialist, so one ambulance ride later I was in a hospital stall deal, crying in pain, with nurses coming every so often but not enough since i wasn’t given any pain medicine besides numbing eye drops strictly administered by the nurses. At this point nobody was saying anything reassuring about my vision, which was very concerning. I honestly thought I’d have severe permanent damage to my eyes and vision. 

Eventually I got discharged (after like 6 hours and at 3 in the morning) with a shit ton of meds and saw an eye specialist the next day who gave me more stuff to put in my eyeballs, a medicated contact lense for the eye that got the worst, and those good good numbing eye drops. 

Ended up with burns not only on my corneas, but my eyelids, the corners of my eyes, and below my eyes. one of the burns actually looked like a huge cat eye. Needless to say, quite painful to happen and to recover from. 

3 weeks off work, most of it spent in the dark, and getting new glasses because i didn’t wear them at work. My vision is significantly worse than before, but nothing the glasses can’t fix. Lesson learned.

This coming from a woman who didn’t own her own property (production paid for it, before that, her father paid her rent alway) she was always looking down at other peoples homes. Too bad Harry was too dim to see it as a red flag.
